# Static Website Boilerplate

## The Problem
I found myself losing time by spending the first hour of every project just setting up folders and variable names. This repetitive manual setup felt like a waste of time that could be better spent actually building the actual website. I needed a way to jump straight from an idea to development.

## The Solution
I engineered this ready-to-use efficient static website boilerplate to serve as a launchpad for my all my websites. By having a pre-defined system, I ensure that every site I build—whether for a local shop or an NGO—starts with the same project file structure so that I reduce the amount of time I waste.

## Tech Stack
I chose to stick with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS because I wanted to build websites that are future-proof. By avoiding frameworks, the resulting sites are lightweight, load almost instantly for users, and are easy for anyone to maintain without having to know 70 different framework. This approach actually results in a better user experience.

## Project File Structure
The project file structure is designed to be modular and efficient, by putting the files in separate folders.

```

```

## Thought Process
* I started with creating the file structure and uploading to GitHub in order to save my progress and document it

## AI Use
I used AI as a technical peer to help with repetitive tasks such as troubleshooting Git CLI commands (I'm still learning how to use Git). This allowed me to stay focused on the important part of the project while still learning the best practices for professional documentation and version control.
